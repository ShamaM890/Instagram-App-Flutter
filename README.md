# Instagram App (Flutter UI Clone)


## 🔎 Short description

Instagram-App-Flutter — A Flutter-based Instagram-style UI clone intended for learning, UI/UX practice, and demonstration. This repository focuses on building a clean, responsive interface (feed, stories, profile, post creation, and basic navigation) using Flutter widgets and best-practices for structuring a medium-sized app.

Note: This README is written to be practical and ready-to-use. Replace placeholder images/paths/commands below with actual project files if they differ.


## ✨ Features

Clean Instagram-like UI (Home feed with posts, stories bar, profile page)

Bottom navigation (Home, Search, Add, Activity, Profile)

Post card widget showing image, likes, comments, and timestamp

Story preview circles at top of feed

Profile screen with grid/list view of posts

Local placeholder for post creation (image picker or sample images)

Responsive layout that works on Android, iOS and Flutter Web (if enabled)

If your project already implements auth, cloud storage, Firestore or other backend features, you can add short docs for them in the Setup section.
